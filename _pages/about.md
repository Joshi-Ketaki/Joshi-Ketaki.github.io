I am a second year Ph.D student in the [Yale Systems and Architecture group](https://ysarch.csl.yale.edu/). My advisor is [Prof. Abhishek Bhattacherjee](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/abhishek/). I am co-advised by [Prof. Zhong Shao](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/shao/) and [Prof. Anurag Khandelwal](http://anuragkhandelwal.com/). I am broadly interested in building accelerator-centric Operating Systems in the wake of new-age applications such as neural implants. More specifically, I am working on formalizing the asynchronous programming model to glean reliability, security, throughput and system utilization in these new Operating System architectures.

My primary research interests are Operating Systems, Formal Methods and Computer Architecture.

Before coming to Yale, I was a part of the Compiler Optimization group at NVIDIA. My work had been on working on the compiler backend support for Turing architecture which was released in 2018.

I wrote my undergraduate thesis at the [GCC Resource Center](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/grc/) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/). Here, I developed a compiler optimizer generator which could generate compiler optimizers for custom analysis-transformation pairs.
