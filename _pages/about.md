About me:
======
I am a second year Ph.D student in the [Yale Systems and Architecture group](https://ysarch.csl.yale.edu/). My advisor is [Prof. Abhishek Bhattacherjee](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/abhishek/). I am co-advised by [Prof. Zhong Shao](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/shao/) and [Prof. Anurag Khandelwal](http://anuragkhandelwal.com/). 

Research:
=========
The Computer Architecture stack in today’s systems is becoming more heterogenous than ever. Today’s systems cater to safety-critical or real-time applications more often, making high throughput, increased system utilization, reliability and security a necessity rather than a feature. Asynchronous interfaces in form of asynchronous system services or micro-services help achieve the goal of increased system utilization and throughput. Formalizing the non-intuitive asynchronous model makes it achievable for safety-critical applications as well as eases programming complexity in any application. Hence, I am looking at formalizing the asynchronous programming interface to make it easy to reason about in terms of programmability, safety and correctness.

I broadly envision building accelerator centric Operating Systems. My primary research interests are Operating Systems, Formal Methods and Computer Architecture.

Before coming to Yale, I was a part of the Compiler Optimization group at NVIDIA. My work had been on working on the compiler backend support for the then upcoming Turing architecture which was released in 2018.

I wrote my undergraduate thesis at the [GCC Resource Center](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/grc/) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/). Here, I developed a compiler optimization generator.
