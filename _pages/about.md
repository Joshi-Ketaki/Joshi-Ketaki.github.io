I am a second year Ph.D student in the [Yale Systems and Architecture group](https://ysarch.csl.yale.edu/). I am broadly interested in building accelerator-centric Operating Systems in the wake of new-age applications such as neural implants. More specifically I am working on formalizing the asynchrnous programming model to glean reliability, security, throughput and system utilization in these new Operating System architectures.

Before coming to Yale, I was a part of the Compiler optimization group at NVIDIA. My work had been on working on the compiler backend support for Turing architecture which was released in 2018.

I wrote my undergraduate thesis at the [GCC Resource Center](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/grc/) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/). Here, I developed a compiler optimizer generator which could generate compiler optimizers for custom analysis-transformation pairs.
