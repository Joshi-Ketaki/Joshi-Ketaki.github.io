Research
======
The Computer Architecture stack in today's systems is becoming more heterogenous than ever. Today's systems cater to safety-critical or real-time applications more often making high throughput, increased system utilization, reliability and security a necessity rather than a feature. Asynchronous interfaces in form of asynchronous system services or micro-services help achieve the goal of increased system utilization and throughput. Formalizing the non-intuitive asynchronous model makes it achievable for safety-critical applications as well as eases programming complexity in any application. Hence, I am looking at formalizing the asynchronous programming interface to make it easy to reason about in terms of programmability, safety and correctness.
