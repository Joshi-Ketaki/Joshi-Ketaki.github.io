Research
======
The Computer Architecture stack in today's systems is ecoming more heterogenous than ever. Today's systems cater to safety-critical or real-time applications more often making high throughput, increased system utilization, reliability and security a necessity rather than a feature. Asynchnrous interfaces in form of asyncchrnous system services or micro-services make a lot of sense in this context. Hence, I am looking at formalizing the asynchronous programming interface to make it reachabble in terms of programmability and safety.

The final goal of the research is to come up with a formal specification for the asychronous programming model. This will not only ease the use of asynchrony in existing architecture but also for new-age architectures that are aiming for accelerator oriented Operating System.
