Talked about the custom compiler-backend optimization generator that was built at IIT Bombay for the undergraduate thesis. Given a specification i.e. Gen, Kill and In and Out equations for a static analysis, the generator could generate an optimization pass for those equations on the fly. The talk was under the ACM-Women's Chapter in Cummins College of Engineering, University of Pune.
