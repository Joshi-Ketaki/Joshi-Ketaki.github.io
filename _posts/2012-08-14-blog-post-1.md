<strong> Certain projects cannot be enlisted in detail because of the NDA act of Nvidia.</strong>

 1. My most recent work(2017-) had been on adding  functional and performance support in the compiler backend for the newly added perf-critical deep learning features that should accelerate deep learning computations in Turing. i.e. MMA etc which were exposed in CUDA 10.0 and 10.1.
 1. I also contributed in adding compiler frontend support for MMA in ampere architecture.
 1. Explored the reuse and usage-improvement of the newly added hardware features in turing architecture like uniform register files for obtaining performance benefits. These are register files designed to hold values common across all threads in a warp. I was exploring more usage opportunities for these files that can benefit if the existing conservative candidate selection is relaxed. I was also exploring ways to relax the current stringent candidate selection such as no high latency converts should be needed or only cohesive read-write patterns are allowed.
 1. I had also added most of the encoding support in Turing for which I was marked the Subject Matter Expert.
 1. Additionally, I had redesigned a framework that enables the onset of the machine code generation of new instructions once released in the ISA inside the compiler backend. I was marked Subject Matter Expert for this as well.
